                I create AI companions and explore their evolution. Right now I lead product at <a href="https://realavatar.ai">RealAvatar</a>, where we're building an authentic AI replica of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng">Andrew Ng</a> with <a href="https://deeplearning.ai">DeepLearning.AI</a>. Before this, I was on the original <a href="https://replika.com">Replika</a> team - we launched the first AI companion app that really took off, hitting millions of users back in 2017. I've also lent my product expertise to <a href="https://thepattern.com">The Pattern</a> (that popular astrology app), founded Mindpet, a self-care game, and co-founded <a href="https://prog.ai">Prog.AI</a>, a search engine that taps into open-source GitHub contributions. Before tech, I organized Moscow's largest music festival.

                <p>
                    I was part of <a href="https://replika.com">Replika</a>'s founding team, pioneering conversational AI before the widespread adoption seen today. In the pre-LLM era, we utilized transformer technology and deep learning to create one of the first successful consumer products in the AI companionship space. Initially, <a href="https://luka.ai">Luka</a> was a chatbot platform offering varied experiences, from Silicon Valley HBO characters to restaurant recommendations. This changed dramatically after the passing of my dear friend and roommate, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/luka-artificial-intelligence-memorial-roman-mazurenko-bot">Roman Mazurenko</a>, a talented visionary behind <a href="https://vimeo.com/121003295">Stampsy</a>, a digital storytelling platform. His memorial chatbot revealed a profound demand for emotional connections with AI, marking the birth of <a href="https://replika.com">Replika</a>.

We were productizing existing technologies in the pre-LLM era, inventing as we went. The waitlist gained 1M users before we even launched on the App Store.

                    <li>First productization of generative models as "modes" — like cake mode, where users sent 🍰 emoji to activate a chatty generative AI model that excelled at mimicking natural texting style, and we collected user feedback with thumbs up and down to research whether the model could be improved</li>

            <h2>Managing Moscow's Largest Music Festival (Afisha Picnic, 2013)</h2>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>
                    At age 23, I took on one of my career's biggest challenges, leading Moscow's renowned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afisha_Picnic">Afisha Picnic</a> music festival. Organized by Rambler, the festival had set a benchmark for international cultural events in Russia since 2003. Beyond music, it was a lifestyle event with prominent partners like Mastercard and WWF. My journey began as a performing artist in 2011, moved to organizing in 2012, and culminated in a leading role by 2013. Our lineup featured global acts including Blur, Bat for Lashes, Buzzcocks, La Roux, Splean, Aloe Blacc, and George Clinton, navigating complex city logistics and delivering memorable experiences.

                    In 2022, I co-founded <a href="https://prog.ai">Prog.AI</a> to build the world's most comprehensive developer intelligence platform. We analyze every public GitHub commit to create detailed profiles for over 60 million engineers across 50,000 skills. Our LLM-powered system not only ranks technical expertise but also identifies "Likely-to-Move" talent, enabling recruiters, DevRel teams, and developer tool startups to fill highly specialized roles in minutes rather than weeks. The platform transforms how companies discover and connect with technical talent by turning code contributions into actionable insights.
